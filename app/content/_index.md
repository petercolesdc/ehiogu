That’s right; witness the glory that is the 2018 MerB’ys Calendar, brought to you by Canada’s Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) Beard and Moustache Club.

Because between the handlebar waxing and goatee combing, these burly men are stripping down and flaunting their fins in a novel take on the classic charity calendar shoot. We know how important regular and up-to-date reports on road, rail and other modes of transport incidents are for the UK audience. We have therefore been working on incorporating this information within the Local News offering online. You will be able to find all the latest severe travel incidents on our local live services and on news stories which feature travel disruption. We also hope to feed travel updates into the personalised news services we are developing.
